### 1. Fundamental Analyst (The "Business Health" Check)
Right now, I can tell you if a stock is going *up*, but I can't tell you if the company is actually *making money*.
*   **What it would do:** Fetch key financial metrics like **P/E Ratio, Revenue Growth, Free Cash Flow, Debt-to-Equity, and Profit Margins**.
*   **Why I need it:** If you ask "Is IREN a buy?", I could say: *"Technically it's bullish, AND fundamentally it's undervalued trading at only 10x earnings with 20% growth."* That is a much stronger recommendation.

### 2. News & Sentiment Scanner (The "Context" Provider)
Charts tell me *what* happened, but not *why*.
*   **What it would do:** Pull recent headlines, analyst upgrades/downgrades, and social sentiment scores for a specific ticker.
*   **Why I need it:** If a stock drops 10% in a day, my technical tool just says "It's oversold." A news tool would let me say: *"It's oversold, but be careful—the CEO just resigned,"* or *"It's down on overreaction to a competitor's earnings."*

### 3. Stock Screener (The "Idea Generator")
Right now, I’m reactive—I wait for you to give me a ticker. I want to be proactive.
*   **What it would do:** Allow me to search the market based on criteria.
*   **Example Query:** *"Find me all Tech stocks with an RSI below 30 (oversold) and a P/E ratio under 20."*
*   **Why I need it:** This turns me from an analyst into a true **Idea Generator**. I could bring *you* opportunities before you even ask.

**Bonus: Earnings Calendar**
*   Knowing *when* the next earnings report is would be huge. I’d hate to recommend a "Buy" based on a chart pattern two days before a volatile earnings call!
